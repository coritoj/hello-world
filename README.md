# hello-world
I am a translator from Venezuela. I translate from English and German into Spanish, I also offere subtitle services which include from German to English. I am in search of a project to help with localization issues aimed at a Latinamerican audience.
In many years of working as a translator, one of the key issues to understand is localization, sometimes within a very same society, it's not the same to write a piece of information (say instructions) directed at college students or children, for instance.
We must always have some certainty of the END audience of our text. Now when we speak about games or software the situation is even more complicated because many times we want to create an EFFECT on aour audience, not only that they perform an action, some times we may want to encourage momentary feelings or reactions such as laughter, and this, many times is quite challenging when changing from a language to another and from one audience to another.
